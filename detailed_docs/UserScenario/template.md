User Scenarios

Think of user scenarios as a real-world narrative of the process to accomplish a user's goal.
A user scenario will articulate the goal, the process, and the outcome that is contextually relevant to the user.
In doing so, a lot can be discovered or validated about the assumptions regarding the user and their situation/problem.

(a) User scenarios are thus quite useful in requirements discovery: trying to understand how the user is going to go about solving their problem will point to various kinds of flows and objects that are needed to accomplish a task.  
So, the exploratory/discovery type of scenario usage helps one plan a user interface and system interaction for supporting the user's needs.  
You will have have a clearer definition of the path the user will go through, and the system objects (tools) they will need to reach the end of that path.  
Note that there must be no reference to a user interface or user interface elements. Keep it high level.

e.g.  
Scenario:
Josh is a 30 something mid-level manager for an ad agency, metro-sexual and beer aficionado. He likes to try new and exotic beers in trendy locations. He also enjoys using a variety of social apps on his smart phone. He reads a review on Yelp of a new burger & beer joint downtown with over 100 beers on tap, and decides to go walk over after work and check it out.

**(b) A second type of user scenario that I've identified is  
the type to validate a design and design assumptions.**  
You've created a user interface design and employing a real-world narrative helps you see whether the path that the user takes is realistic or not.  
Does it seem reasonable that they do X when presented with Y in trying to accomplish Z?  
We can tell a lot about the sensibility of your designs as we match up the design to a real scenario.  
Here it's okay to talk about the user interface.  
Note that this type bears a lot of similarities to the usability testing scenario or cognitive walkthrough technique.



User scenarios

User scenarios are much more detailed and include details such as user's motivation and environment.
As opposed to the simple narrative of above, these are often presented in storyboards and as "blueprints" with a lot of details and texture that may often be superfluous.

User scenarios paint a picture that is more complete, but they are often viewed as superfluous on projects that have an aggressive schedule.
When to use scenarios depends on the project and the needs of the project.
